# todo-list

First version of a task manager web application, written using JavaScript and Node.js (with EJS, Express and MongoDB). This app was developed with the intent to learn how to use Node.js, Express and MongoDB to create a back-end that can contain all of the functionality of the app.

In this version of the app, you can add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them and create different lists by adding whichever name you choose as \<name\> to the end of the URL. I plan to return to this app in the future and implement new features, as well as integration with other applications.
